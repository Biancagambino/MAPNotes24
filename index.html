        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Weather Photography Project! This project explores the visual and environmental differences between cold weather and warm weather through photography. The project aims to capture the unique characteristics and impacts of these two types of weather on landscapes, people, and daily life.</p>

        <h2>Cold Weather</h2>
        <div class="weather-description">
            <h3>Characteristics of Cold Weather</h3>
            <p>Cold weather is often associated with low temperatures, frost, snow, and shorter daylight hours. The landscape is typically covered in a blanket of snow, giving it a serene and sometimes harsh appearance. Cold weather can impact daily life by necessitating warm clothing, heating, and changes in transportation methods. The beauty of cold weather lies in its crisp, clear air and the unique patterns formed by ice and snow.</p>

        <h2>Warm Weather</h2>
        <div class="weather-description">
            <h3>Characteristics of Warm Weather</h3>
            <p>Warm weather is characterized by higher temperatures, longer daylight hours, and vibrant, lush landscapes. This type of weather encourages outdoor activities, social gatherings, and a more relaxed lifestyle. Warm weather often brings bright sunshine, clear skies, and flourishing vegetation, making it ideal for photography that captures life, energy, and color.</p>

    <div class="content" id="impact">
        <h2>Impact of Weather</h2>
        <p>The impact of weather on daily life and the environment is profound. Cold weather can lead to challenges such as frostbite, hypothermia, and difficulties in travel. It can also create stunningly beautiful scenes that are perfect for photography. On the other hand, warm weather promotes growth, activity, and social interaction, but can also bring challenges like heatwaves and droughts. Through photography, this project aims to highlight the contrasts and complementarities of these two weather conditions, showing how they shape the world around us in distinct ways.</p>
